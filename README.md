# Python-For-Devops üöÄ
Welcome to the **PYTHON-FOR-DEVOPS** repository! This project will be helpfull for you if you are starting your Devops journey and wants to learn the fundaments of python
## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is divided into four main folders, each with a specific focus:

- **applications/**: A Flask-based web application.
- **day01/**: Basic Python concepts with hands-on exercises.
- **day02/**: Advanced topics including API testing, data structures, and a weather app.
- **day03/**: A backup system to safeguard project files.

### Folder Breakdown

| Folder | Description | Key Files |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **applications** | A Flask web app for practical web development.          | `app.py`                                                                                 |
| **day01**        | Introduces Python basics with examples.                 | `con1.py`, `concepts.py`, `conditionals.py`, `input_output.py`, `project1.py`, `task.py` |
| **day02**        | Covers API testing, data structures, and a weather app. | `api_test.py`, `data_structs.py`, `project1.py`, `sys_utils.py`, `weather.py`            |
| **day03**        | Contains a backup system for file management.           | `backup.py`                                                                              |

   cd applications
   python app.py
   ```
Visit http://localhost:5000 to see the web app in action.

## day01/
Explore Python basics:
```bash
cd day01
python concepts.py  # Or any other script
```
Run individual scripts to learn conditionals, input/output, and more.

## day02/
# Data Structures:
```bash
python data_structs.py
```
# Weather App:
```Bash
